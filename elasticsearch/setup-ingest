This one first: 
Setup pipeline initially
PUT _ingest/pipeline/attachment
{
  "description" : "Extract attachment information",
  "processors" : [
    {
      "attachment" : {
        "field" : "compresseddata"
      }
    }
  ]
}

From <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/using-ingest-attachment.html> 


Send a file to the pipeline to be ingested
PUT my_index/my_type/my_id?pipeline=attachment
{
  "compresseddata": "e1xydGYxXGFuc2kNCkxvcmVtIGlwc3VtIGRvbG9yIHNpdCBhbWV0DQpccGFyIH0="
}

For example:
PUT scarf/file/1234?pipeline=attachment
{
  "compresseddata": "e1xydGYxXGFuc2kNCkxvcmVtIGlwc3VtIGRvbG9yIHNpdCBhbWV0DQpccGFyIH0="
}
